        "content": "Every week, we continue to see news about the 2020 election and the shocking, seditious efforts to tear down our democracy that followed. for conspiracies to overturn the election. of the Jan. 6 riots. against two Georgia election workers. Accountability for these past actions is critically important. But as these stories dominate the news cycle again and again, it is important not to lose sight of one of the unconscionable continuing consequences — the increase in hostility toward our nation’s election officials, and the impact it has on our democracy. Since 2020, a shocking number of election officials nationwide, many beaten down by harassment, threats, interference in their jobs and lack of support, . Rather than gradually declining in the years since 2020, the hostility, threats and intimidation of election workers has continued, and it impacts election officials — and voters — in every state, and in every party. Election workers don’t leave these jobs lightly — they are some of the most fiercely committed and staunch public servants there are. But they are also and when you add in threats, intimidation and hostility, it begins to take its toll. Election administrator Heider Garcia of Tarrant County, Texas, experienced years of threats and racist messages following 2020, but it wasn’t until April 2023 that he resigned. In 2023, in Buckingham County, Va., threats and harassment caused the entire election office to quit, and not even a month later, the county fired the new registrar. Election directors in 10 of Nevada’s 17 counties have resigned or retired since 2020 — many of them due to intimidation and hostility. As Pennsylvania secretary of State in 2020, I, along with my husband, stayed in undisclosed locations for some time as a result of threats following the November election, and I was very grateful for law enforcement and others who provided protection. Many of us in similar positions were hoping against hope as we looked to each ensuing official action — final court decisions, the meeting of the Electoral College, audits, recounts and, of course, Jan. 6 and then Inauguration Day — that as facts were proven and the rule of law was upheld, the threats and efforts to tear down our democracy would end. Unfortunately, none of this has stopped the flood of political violence. Newer candidates continue to spew hostile and baseless allegations, and the flood of intimidation and threats continue to track these false narratives. As recently as 2022, my family received threats based on flagrant lies being repeated about the 2020 election. This must stop. In addition to being an affront to humanity, these threats are an injury to our ability to vote. Every election worker that leaves means our voters and electoral system must rely on inexperienced workers who lack institutional knowledge to carry out complex election processes. The mass exodus of election staff leaves gaps in cybersecurity, chain of custody, auditing and many other advanced skills that strengthen election security and integrity, not to mention mentorship for new staff. And all of this leads to a never-ending cycle of prophecy fulfillment for the conspiracy theorists — in creating chaos and fear for election workers and voters, election denialism is its own poison. We need to strengthen protections for election workers now, and this must be done at the federal, state and local levels. Congress should pass the to provide more resources to recruit and train election workers and increase protections against threats and intimidation of election workers and interference in the electoral process. We should also strengthen these protections at the state level; states can look to many statutory models, including those enacted this year in . And we also must provide support directly to local officials by to help deter and respond to threats. Any hope for secure elections for our dedicated election workers and voters alike — not to mention the survival of our democracy and our fundamental right to vote — depends on it.",

        "content": "Around 4,000 union workers at Mack Trucks facilities went on strike Monday morning after rejecting a tentative contract Sunday evening. Striking Mack workers in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Florida are represented by the United Auto Workers (UAW) union, which is also actively engaged in separate negotiations with three major Detroit automakers. Nearly three-quarters — 73 percent — of workers voted against the tentative deal, UAW President Shawn Fain sent Sunday to the director of employee relations at Volvo, which owns Mack. Mack workers walked out at 7 a.m., according to the union, upping the pressure on the automotive industry. More than 30,000 UAW workers across 22 states are now on the picket line, the UAW said in a . “I’m inspired to see UAW members at Mack Trucks holding out for a better deal, and ready to stand up and walk off the job to win it,” Fain said in the statement. Union leaders had with Mack on Oct. 1 that included a 10 percent wage increase in the first year, a compounded 20 percent wage increase over the five-year contract, a $3,500 bonus upon contract ratification and a guarantee that health insurance premiums would not increase. But the union and the company remain at odds on issues including “wage increases, cost of living allowances (COLA), job security, wage progression, skilled trades, shift premium, holiday schedules, work schedules, health and safety, seniority, pension, 401(k), healthcare and prescription drug coverage, and overtime,” Fain wrote in the letter. Mack Trucks said in a that the company was “surprised and disappointed” by the union’s decision to strike, a decision it called “unnecessary.” The statement also emphasized that the UAW had called the tentative agreement a record for the heavy truck industry. “The members have the final say, and it’s their solidarity and organization that will win a fair contract at Mack,” Fain said. Neither the UAW nor Mack Trucks returned requests for comment from The Hill. The UAW has set expectations high in its bargaining with Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the three major Detroit automakers against which the UAW at selected facilities Sept. 15. The initial strikes targeted one assembly plant for each automaker. The union to include 38 GM and Stellantis parts warehouses and Ford and GM assembly plants. The UAW announced Friday that it the strikes after GM agreed to bring electric vehicle facilities into the UAW contract, unionizing roles around which there had been and progress with all three automakers.",

        "content": "The Justice Department is fighting an effort by former President Trump to delay his documents case until after the 2024 election, pushing back on claims the government hasn’t done its part to provide access to evidence. A recent motion seeking to delay the process through a law governing the handling of classified records in court “was but a precursor to a motion to continue the trial date,” special counsel Jack Smith’s office . “None of the issues raised in the defendants’ motion warrants the continuance they request.” The request from Trump’s team last week from his legal team about the amount of classified evidence they’ve been able to review in the case, as well as their workload, as they manage numerous indictments filed against the former president. They asked to delay the case until “at least mid-November 2024.” The attorneys say they have yet to get access to all classified evidence underpinning charges in a superseding indictment that accused Trump of an additional Espionage Act charge and of trying to delete security camera footage from his Florida home. Trump’s team also complains that it “only has access to a small, temporary facility in Miami” to view the highly classified records. It must visit the facility in person while managing hearing dates for Trump’s trial on allegations he sought to block the transfer of power after losing the 2020 election. But the special counsel’s office said Trump’s team is exaggerating its struggles. “Reports, transcripts, and recordings of interviews with potential witnesses—essentially, the blueprint of the Government’s case-in-chief—have been made available within days of arraignment for all defendants, even though the Court’s scheduling order authorizes the Government to delay production of such materials until just before trial,” they wrote. “In no way does the government’s record of unclassified discovery production in this case support a continuance.” The government said delays in accessing some documents are due to the highly sensitive nature of the documents. “To be sure, the extreme sensitivity of the special measures documents that Trump illegally retained at Mar-a-Lago presents logistical issues unique to this case. But the defendants’ allegations that those logistical impediments are the fault of the [special counsel’s office] are wrong,” the government notes, adding that Trump’s team has been able to view them in Washington, D.C., versus Florida. The argument comes after Trump’s team was complaining about traveling between D.C. and Florida to manage the former president’s two federal prosecutions. In Florida, Trump is facing 32 counts for violation of the Espionage Act for mishandling records, as well as numerous other charges relating to obstruction of justice in blocking their return to authorities.",

        "content": "Mental health is something some of us never really considered in the past. But as the world has changed and the internet becomes a non-stop bombardment of information, our mental health is certainly we all should consider assessing. Estimated reading time: 3 minutes How well do you know your mind? Have you had a moment recently to check in on how you are feeling — both in body and in mind? For many, the answers to these questions may not be positive, which is why World Mental Health Day is an important reminder to look after our mental health the same way we do our physical health. Here’s what Samsung’s press release has to say about the partnership with Massachusetts General Hospital and its Galaxy Watch studies. Mental health conditions are prevalent around the world, and are oftentimes overlooked and overshadowed by our hectic daily lives. Although an all-too-common occurrence, issues can go unchecked when people aren’t aware of a mental health condition, or even ignored when it becomes apparent, leading to them suffering in silence. However, as more and more people around the world have begun to realize the importance of mental health awareness, demand for a better understanding of mental well-being and convenient ways to monitor it daily is increasing. This is why, as part of its ongoing work to expand the functionality and benefits of its wearable devices, Samsung is partnering with Massachusetts General Hospital(MGH), an affiliate hospital of Harvard Medical School, to take wearable mental health data capabilities even further. As a company dedicated to providing users with more in-depth insights into their holistic wellness, Samsung believes that wearable devices, like the Galaxy Watch, can be useful in increasing awareness around mental health. Wearables accompany us throughout our day and may have the potential to help users better understand their mental health status based on physical measurements. Samsung and Massachusetts General Hospital psychiatry department experts are collaborating to conduct a study using the Galaxy Watch to understand the relationship between factors such as sleep, physical activity[2], heart rate, daily routines and a user’s mental health status. In the study, researchers will analyze watch data from the participants to understand how the smartwatches can be used as an efficient and convenient tool to monitor an individual’s mental health. “This study is an excellent example of Samsung’s commitment to bringing new health monitoring tools to Galaxy wearable users worldwide and providing a comprehensive wellness experience,” said Hon Pak, Vice President and Head of the Digital Health Team, MX Business at Samsung Electronics. “Through our work with Massachusetts General Hospital, we aim to empower users with a better understanding of their mental wellbeing more conveniently, and give them a more complete picture of their holistic health, including mind and body.” Samsung is one of the leaders in the next era of digital health monitoring with advanced sensors, including the groundbreaking Samsung BioActive Sensor[3]. With a proven history of working closely with industry leaders, Samsung is collaborating with Massachusetts General Hospital to explore new technologies that deliver expanded mental health insight functions, building on the foundation of Samsung’s health features ecosystem to create new possibilities in wellness monitoring. “Our project with Samsung holds the potential to give users an improved understanding of their mental health through smartwatch data,” said Amanda Baker, PhD, Director of the Center for Anxiety and Traumatic Stress Disorders at Massachusetts General Hospital. “Living with stress is a daily challenge for so many, so our hope is our collaboration with Samsung will offer people a more in-depth perspective on their mental well-being daily.” What do you think of this partnership?

        "description": "The game as we know it now, a mixture of farming sim and creature collector, has gone through many iterations.",
        "content": "Four years ago, in 2019, cozy games were on the rise but not yet quite as saturated as they are today. It was the year the original concept for Paleo Pines, and Lucky the Parasaurolophus, was created by Jordan Bradley as part of a game jam. And when this concept was shared on Twitter it clearly struck a chord with many people at the time. A game about cute dinos? Sign us up! The whole Italic Pig team loved it, so we took the concept into production. Paleo Pines has evolved a lot since then, but cute dinosaurs in a harmonious countryside remained at the heart of it. The game as we know it now, a mixture of farming sim and creature collector, has gone through many iterations, but in fact didn’t always have farming as a mechanic. For example, one of the earliest ideas we tried was harvesting dino eggs and trading them. Only that didn’t work. In the wholesome world of Paleo, there was no place for stealing dino babies and selling them. Our dinos are free beings – they live on our ranch of their own free will because they’re our friends. Taking their eggs just felt… wrong. As the team prototyped and pitched various ideas, Paleo still hadn’t found its feet. Then, in summer 2020, we nailed down the core vision: a love-letter to childhood, and those long breezy summers we all remember. This helped tie everything together – mechanically, visually, and in the audio too. Paleo Pines as we know it now was born. In our high level vision, we locked down our core pillars: finding and befriending Dinosaurs, a sense of whimsical Discovery, and being part of a harmonious and safe Community by contributing as a Settler running a farm. And we stayed true to these pillars from then on, though not without challenges along the way. And the dinos were absolutely at the heart of the experience and what would set our game apart. Here is a quote directly from the document we made in 2020. “The most important part of the Paleo Pines experience are the dinosaurs. Without them, the game would not be Paleo Pines. Interacting with your dinosaurs should feel like they are your friend, your lifelong pet, and your helper. Players build a connection with their dinosaurs gradually, and form a genuine bond. Dinosaurs are a joy to watch, and a joy to interact with. They evoke feelings of childhood nostalgia, of warmth, and of friendship. While riding a dinosaur, the player should feel a sense of empowerment and fun, regardless of the steed.” Let’s face it, these prehistoric creatures are endlessly fascinating, with new discoveries continually unearthed. While not every game has to be educational or scientifically informed, part of the childhood obsession with dinosaurs is the facts about them. That’s why we worked with a consultant palaeontologist. For example, based on footprints, it’s believed that Parasaurolophus and other hadrosaurids were both bipedal and quadrupedal - that’s why Lucky runs on twos and walks on all fours. And did you know that velociraptors were feathered? This was discovered years after Jurassic Park first aired, so the velociraptor of popular imagination looks quite different to the real thing. It was fascinating to learn so much about dinosaurs and other creatures as we developed the game further. We had to solve a number of creative challenges where realism wasn’t possible, but still put a lot of thought into. Such as which dinosaurs were best suited to which skills. For example, the Therizinosaurs is a theropod with unusually long claws. It made sense for this dinosaur to become one of our harvesters. Some of our dinos smash rocks. We had long debates whether the Pachycephalosaurus, which has a boney head, would be a suitable smasher. (The answer, in case you’re curious, was yes in the end. But it could have easily gone the other way.) The Future of Paleo Pines We have huge dreams for Paleo Pines including expanding the world, introducing more dinos, bringing the game to other entertainment formats - but all of this will be decisions to be made in the future because right now our focus is on ensuring the the current players of the game are well taken care of through support for bug patches and introducing new players to our welcoming Discord community. It’s also crucially important to us that any further development is fan-led because now that it’s out into the world, this game doesn’t belong to us any more and we owe it to those that have supported us to listen and respond to what they want to see next. Paleo Pines released on PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch on September 26th! You can get the game or play the demo on Steam You can grab a copy of the game on consoles through the Paleo Pines website",

        "content": "has been appointed to a second term as the Jack and Rilla Neafsey Dean and Vice Provost of Cornell Tech, Provost Michael I. Kotlikoff announced Oct. 9. The Cornell Board of Trustees’ Executive Committee voted Sept. 14 to approve a new five-year term, effective July 1, 2024. Morrisett’s tenure as dean began July 1, 2019. He is also a professor in the Department of Computer Science in the Cornell Ann S. Bowers College of Computing and Information Science. “Greg has been an inspirational leader in the establishment and growth of Cornell Tech, the Roosevelt Island Cornell campus and the New York City tech landscape,” Kotlikoff said. “I’m thrilled for him to continue in his role as dean: growing Cornell Tech programs, fostering intercampus collaborations, attracting outstanding students and faculty, leading exciting K-12 tech educational programs and driving innovation and startups in New York City.” launched in 2012, in temporary offices in Google’s New York City building, and moved to its permanent campus on Roosevelt Island in 2017. The campus is home to close to 50 tenure track and nontenured faculty members, approximately 400 master’s students across eight programs, and more than 100 doctoral students in five fields. Since its launch, Cornell Tech has graduated about 1,900 students. As part of a land-grant institution, Cornell Tech has a deep responsibility to serve New Yorkers, Morrisett said. The land-grant mission is evident in the campus’s efforts to help diversify the tech ecosystem, educate students to design and build solutions that tackle real-world challenges, and develop deep connections in New York City’s tech industry, he said. “I’m just super proud of how New York’s tech scene has exploded over the last decade, and I think we can take our fair share of credit for this,” Morrisett said. Some key accomplishments during Morrisett’s first term: In Morrisett’s coming term, the opportunities and challenges presented by AI will be a key focus. Along with developing AI technologies for health care, education and climate change, Cornell Tech will be at the forefront of applying deep research to address the new technology’s major shortcomings. Overcoming bias in data-driven decision making, the massive amounts of energy needed for AI systems, and safeguarding against job losses to computers and robots are all areas of concern, Morrisett said. “I believe we have a very short window to steer the AI age in the right directions,” he said. “Cornell Tech is uniquely positioned – through our amazing faculty and students, our deep connections to the city of New York and our Cornell heritage – to have an outsized impact on the technical and social challenges we face.” Morrisett’s own research focuses on the application of programming language technology for building secure, reliable and high-performance software systems. He has worked with students to design programming languages that rule out whole classes of bugs. With respect to software and security, he has served in advising and steering capacities with the National Academies of Science, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the National Security Agency. Morrisett received his bachelor’s degree in mathematics and computer science from the University of Richmond (1989), and his master’s (1991) and doctoral (1995) degrees in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University. He was a Cornell faculty member in computer science from 1996 to 2004. He was then hired by Harvard University, where he served as associate dean for computer science and engineering, director of the Center for Research on Computation and Society, and professor of computer science, until he returned to Cornell in 2015 as dean of what was then the Faculty of Computing and Information Science. His honors include an honorary doctorate from the University of Richmond (2023); election as a Fellow of the Association of Computing Machinery (2014); a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (2000); and a National Science Foundation Career Award (1999). mediarelations@cornell.edu 607-255-6074 Cornell Chronicle 312 College Ave Ithaca, NY 14850",

        "content": "HENDERSON, Nev. (AP) — Davante Adams made it a point to not only leave on good terms, but to stay in touch with Green Bay's coaching staff, front office and the players who remain from that team two years ago. The timing and not the relationships, he said, was the reason he moved on after eight seasons of catching passes from Aaron Rodgers. But don't expect Adams to become overly sentimental when the Packers visit Las Vegas on Monday night and Adams takes the field against his former team for the first time since being last year. Adams didn't practice Thursday and Friday because of a shoulder injury, but spoke with reporters as if he would play. “Once the game starts, it’s just like every other game,” Adams said. \"It’s not going to be a whole lot of emotion and all that other stuff tied up in it once the clock is ticking.” It was in Green Bay that Adams developed into one of the NFL's top receivers. In three of his final four seasons there, he caught more than 100 passes for more than 1,000 yards. “He played through a contract year, played injured and not everybody does that,” Packers coach Matt LaFleur said. “He was there for our team. He fought through things. He went out there and he told me before the season, he’s like, ‘Hey, listen, I don’t have a contract before the season, you don’t have to worry about it because I’m going to come out there and compete.’” Adams wanted a long-term deal to stay with the Packers, but didn't get the offer that satisfied him. The Packers on March 8, 2022, and then a week later. Two days after that, Adams was on his way to Las Vegas after the Raiders traded their to acquire him. The Raiders made him the league's highest-paid receiver with a five-year, $141.25 million contract. “It was obviously a lot of limbo with Aaron and deciding what his future was going to be like playing football, let alone on that team,” Adams said. “So it wasn’t really a risk that I could take at the time, and it was a decision that had to be made. But had they made the correct offer or submitted something like they did right before I left, then I would have 100 percent been there for another year and then we would obviously see what happened as it moved forward.” Part of Adams' motivation for wanting to move to Las Vegas was the opportunity to once again play with his former Fresno State teammate Derek Carr as well as be closer to his family in California. The first part didn't pan out as well as he would've liked because the with two games left in the season, and the quarterback later . Regardless, Adams did not disappoint last season in catching 100 passes for 1,516 yards and 14 touchdowns. He's off to a sizzling start this season with 33 receptions for 397 yards and three TDs. “It’s pretty evident he’s the best in the league,\" Packers cornerback Jaire Alexander said. Alexander likely will spend a lot of time defending Adams, using his experience from when they practiced daily against each other. Adams called Alexander “one of the most locked-in players” he's known because of his commitment to maximizing his abilities. Alexander would immediately study his iPad after practice and hit up Adams with questions. Facing Alexander will “definitely be different than any head-to-head I’ve had in the past,\" Adams said. \"But it’ll be just like the other ones in the sense that we’re not going to be lined up across from each other every play. He’s not going to follow me, probably, every single play, and that’s just by their defensive scheme. \"It’s just really not how the game is played too much these days. You don’t really see one guy just going wherever the guy is because it gives up a lot of tells of what the defense is doing and just the way that they scheme. So the times that we’ll have, we’ll definitely go and compete.” The Packers saw him in practice and in games for eight years. They know how tough Adams is to defend. “I don’t know if there’s a lot to help against a player of that caliber,\" LaFleur said. \"If he’s not the best, he’s certainly right there. Every time he goes out on the field, every snap, you better know where he’s aligned, you better have a plan for him because he can take over a game. \"We’ve seen it first hand over the years, and I think just some of the plays he’s made this season, these four games, have been unbelievable. But it doesn’t ever surprise me because I’ve seen him do it for years.” ___ AP Sports Writer Steve Megargee contributed to this report. //",

        "content": "Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley raked in more than $11 million in the third quarter of fundraising this year between three of her political committees, her GOP presidential campaign announced Monday. Her campaign noted that close to 40,000 new donors gave to her in the third quarter and that she’s ending the quarter with $11.6 million in the bank. Most notably, her campaign said that $9.1 million of her campaign funds can be used in the GOP primary. While Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a GOP rival of Haley’s in the primary, brought in more this quarter than Haley did by raising $15 million, only $5 million of that sum can be used in the primary. The figures were . “We have seen a big surge in support and have real momentum,” Haley spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas said in a statement. “Nikki is emerging as the candidate who can move America beyond the chaos and drama of the past and present, and we have the resources we need to do it.” The fundraising figures come as some donors have started to view the 2024 GOP primary as a two-person race to become the alternative to former President Trump, who holds comfortable leads in national and local polling. The major donor network American Opportunity Alliance will hear from members of both the DeSantis and Haley campaigns Friday, where they will make a pitch to the group about why donors should be backing their respective campaigns. The DeSantis team has increasingly homed in on Iowa, largely seen as a make-or-break state for a Trump-alternative candidate to blunt the former president’s momentum. The RealClearPolitics polling average of Iowa shows DeSantis in second place behind Trump. Haley’s campaign has noted her performance in New Hampshire and South Carolina, where RealClearPolitics polling averages show her in second place.",
